# LLMAgent Architecture

This guide provides an overview of the LLMAgent architecture, explaining how it builds on AgentForge's signal-driven design while providing LLM-specific abstractions.

## Core Principles

LLMAgent is designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **LLM-Specific Abstractions**: Create patterns optimized for LLM interactions
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly delineate LLM logic from infrastructure
3. **Elixir Ecosystem Integration**: Leverage the strengths of Elixir/OTP
4. **Lightweight Implementation**: Maintain a clean, minimal codebase
5. **Testability**: Ensure components can be tested in isolation

## System Architecture

LLMAgent extends AgentForge's signal-driven architecture with components specifically designed for LLM interactions:

    User[User Input] --> Signals
    Signals --> Flow
    Flow --> Handlers
    Handlers --> Store
    Store --> LLM[LLM Provider]
    LLM --> Store
    Store --> Tools
    Tools --> Store
    Store --> Response[Response]
```

### Core Components

1. **Signals**: Represent events in the agent lifecycle
2. **Handlers**: Process signals and update state
3. **Store**: Manages conversation state and history
4. **Flows**: Combine handlers into coherent sequences
5. **Providers**: Interface with LLM backends
6. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use

## Signal Flow

The typical flow of a conversation follows these steps:

1. User input is converted to a `:user_message` signal
2. The message handler processes the user message and generates a `:thinking` signal
3. The thinking handler calls the LLM and decides whether to use a tool or generate a response
4. If using a tool, it generates a `:tool_call` signal
5. The tool handler executes the tool and generates a `:tool_result` signal
6. The tool result handler incorporates the result and generates a new `:thinking` signal
7. Eventually, the LLM generates a response, creating a `:response` signal
8. The response handler formats and returns the final response

## Component Diagram

Here is a detailed component diagram showing the relationships between the main modules:

```mermaid

    class LLMAgent.Signals {
        +user_message(content)
        +thinking(content)
        +tool_call(name, args)
        +tool_result(name, result)
        +response(content)
        +error(message, source)
    }
    
    class LLMAgent.Handlers {
        +message_handler(signal, state)
        +thinking_handler(signal, state)
        +tool_handler(signal, state)
        +tool_result_handler(signal, state)
        +response_handler(signal, state)
        +error_handler(signal, state)
    }
    
    class LLMAgent.Store {
        +new(initial_state)
        +add_message(state, role, content)
        +add_thought(state, content)
        +add_tool_call(state, name, args, result)
        +prune_thoughts(state, max_thoughts)
    }
    
    class LLMAgent.Flows {
        +conversation(system_prompt, tools, options)
        +task_flow(task_definition, options)
        +batch_processing(items, batch_handler, options)
        +qa_agent(system_prompt, options)
    }
    
    LLMAgent.Signals -- LLMAgent.Handlers
    LLMAgent.Handlers -- LLMAgent.Store
    LLMAgent.Flows -- LLMAgent.Handlers
    LLMAgent.Flows -- LLMAgent.Store
```

## Dynamic Workflow Orchestration

One of LLMAgent's key strengths is its ability to support truly dynamic workflows that emerge from LLM decisions, rather than being hardcoded in advance:

### Workflow Emergence

In a traditional application, the sequence of operations is predetermined by the developer. With LLMAgent, the workflow emerges dynamically:

1. **Context-Based Decisions**: The LLM analyzes user inputs and current state to decide the next steps
2. **Tool Selection**: Tools are chosen dynamically based on the specific needs of the current task
3. **Multi-Step Processing**: Complex tasks are broken down into sequences of operations
4. **Adaptive Responses**: The system adjusts based on intermediate results and user feedback

### Example: Investment Portfolio Creation

The investment portfolio example demonstrates this dynamic capability:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant LLM
    participant Tools
    
    User->>LLM: "Create a retirement portfolio"
    LLM->>LLM: Decide to screen ETFs first
    LLM->>Tools: Execute ETF screener
    Tools-->>LLM: ETF screening results
    LLM->>LLM: Decide to create portfolio
    LLM->>Tools: Execute portfolio constructor
    Tools-->>LLM: Initial portfolio
    LLM->>Tools: Execute portfolio backtester
    Tools-->>LLM: Backtest results
    LLM-->>User: Present portfolio with analysis
    
    User->>LLM: "Lower the risk level"
    LLM->>LLM: Decide to optimize for lower risk
    LLM->>Tools: Execute portfolio optimizer
    Tools-->>LLM: Optimized portfolio
    LLM-->>User: Present adjusted portfolio
```

This workflow was not predefined - it emerged from the LLM's analysis of user requests and available tools. The same architecture can support completely different workflows in other domains without changing the underlying code.

## Extension Points

LLMAgent is designed to be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom Handlers**: Create specialized handlers for domain-specific signals
2. **Custom Flows**: Combine handlers in new ways for different interaction patterns
3. **Custom Tools**: Add new capabilities to your agent
4. **Provider Plugins**: Integrate with different LLM backends

## Design Decisions

### Why Signal-Driven Architecture?

The signal-driven architecture provides several benefits:

1. **Composability**: Handlers can be combined in flexible ways
2. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
3. **Extensibility**: New signals and handlers can be added without changing existing code
4. **Visibility**: The flow of information is explicit and traceable

### Why Elixir?

Elixir's functional nature, pattern matching, and supervision trees make it ideal for building reliable, maintainable agent systems:

1. **Immutable State**: Ensures predictable state transitions
2. **Pattern Matching**: Makes signal handling elegant and explicit
3. **Concurrency**: Allows handling multiple conversations efficiently
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Supervisors can restart failed components
